# Video-Highlights-Detection

In this repo, Video Highlight Detection (VHD) are talked about.

[**Baidu_VH**](http://ai.baidu.com/broad/introduction) is the first large-scale dataset about VDH, main experiments are based on it.




Proposed codes :
- [x] prepare
- [ ] main experiments
- - [x] non-deep models
- - [ ] deep models
- [ ] ablations
- [ ] TBA

-----
Tips:

Non-deep models now have achieved 42% mAP (IoU ranges from 0.5 to 0.95 on BaiduVH dataset, each gap is 0.05)on the validtion set.

Performance on deep models is going to be proposed later.
